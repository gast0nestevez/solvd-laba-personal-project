## Overview

The Airport Travel Advisor is a smart travel planning system designed to help users find the most efficient flight routes between any two airports. Whether direct flights are available or not, the system evaluates multiple flight options, including layovers, estimated travel times, and total costs, to present the most convenient and cost-effective journey.

The core objective is to simulate a real-world flight booking assistant that can:
- Identify all possible routes between two airports
- Account for flight schedules, durations, and transfers
- Calculate and compare travel costs
- Recommend alternative routes when direct flights are unavailable

This project can be especially useful for applications like virtual travel agents or booking systems.
